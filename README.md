M3U8 Proxy Server
Welcome to the M3U8 Proxy Server! Tired of dealing with those pesky CORS errors when trying to stream your M3U8 files? Fear not, because our proxy server is here to save the day!

ðŸŽ¯ What This Project Does
This Node.js application acts as a middleman between your requests and the M3U8 files you're trying to access. Just drop your M3U8 link into the input box, and we'll take care of the rest. Our server proxies the M3U8 file and provides you with a new link to useâ€”free from CORS troubles.
